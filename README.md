# GitHub User and Repository Data Scraper for Austin, TX

This project uses the GitHub API to scrape data on GitHub users based in Austin, Texas, who have over 100 followers, along with details of their public repositories. The data is saved into two CSV files, `users.csv` and `repositories.csv`, for easy analysis and exploration.



## Key Points

- The script leverages the GitHub API to gather data on users in Austin with 100+ followers and up to 500 of their most recent repositories.
- Analysis revealed that a notable number of high-follower users have fewer than 10 public repositories, suggesting a focus on networking or selective sharing.
- Recommendation: Developers can enhance engagement by increasing community contributions and visible public repositories to leverage follower networks more effectively.
